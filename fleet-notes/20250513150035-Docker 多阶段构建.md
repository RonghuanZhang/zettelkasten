# [START gke_quickstarts_hello_app_dockerfile]
FROM golang:1.23.2 as builder
WORKDIR /app
RUN go mod init hello-app
COPY *.go ./
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -o /hello-app

FROM gcr.io/distroless/base-debian11

ENV PORT 8080
USER nonroot:nonroot

```


`COPY-from=builder /hello-app /hello-app` means copying the previous phase result, the hello-app executable file, to the runnable environment.
