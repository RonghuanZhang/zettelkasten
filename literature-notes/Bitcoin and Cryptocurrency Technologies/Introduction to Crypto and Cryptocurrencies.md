# Transcripts

## Welcome

> [[20250608105413]] In this lecture, number one, we're going to do two things. First we'll introduce some cryptographic primitives that turn out to be necessary for talking about cryptocurrencies. In particular, we'll talk about cryptographic hashes and digital signatures, and we'll talk about some of the ways in which those are used to build cryptocurrencies.
