## Cloud SDK

Libraries and tools for interacting with Google Cloud products and services. **Cloud SDK is available at no charge** for users with a Google Cloud account.

- Script or interact with cloud resources at scale using the [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/cli)
- Accelerate local development with emulators for [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub), [Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner), [Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable), and [Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore)[![text that reads 'google cloud SDK' with yellow sun](https://www.gstatic.com/bricks/image/cARoPb_uA2Z7xZU3tF0xGYwBkIjo_xlqm1hl2O3yDKWcyvQfyKyhPRQflnO_unmNUp-J75t4KB92KA.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzFfdtb33K4)

Key features

## Key features

Cloud SDK provides language-specific Cloud Client Libraries supporting each language’s natural conventions and styles. This makes it easier for you to interact with Google Cloud APIs in your language of choice. Client libraries also handle authentication, reduce the amount of necessary boilerplate code, and provide helper functions for pagination of large datasets and asynchronous handling of long-running operations.

### Google Cloud Command Line Interface (gcloud CLI)

The [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/cli) manages authentication, local configuration, developer workflow, and general interactions with Google Cloud resources. With the Google Cloud CLI, it’s easy to perform many common cloud tasks like creating a Compute Engine VM instance, managing a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster, and deploying an App Engine application, either from the command line or in scripts and other automations.[![Image of the man featured in the video wearing a black t-shirt with a cartoon cloud.](https://www.gstatic.com/bricks/image/eaxLSgCv5E1WzXPfiNGv81uAi9T59h3xwgJNAirIZXTpPh_U7nR1tjtG0R7De3epJxo4Dpetj_uy.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v9XWdFyh2E&autoplay=1)
